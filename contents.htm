                So talking about the problems let me exlain you about our first topic :-<br><b>Location & Admission</b>:<br>
                When a student come first time to college then he has no any about location of college so location of the
                college is near Muzaffarpur Junction .It is situated in South side of station after crossing the railway
                lines
                ,on the way there is a vegetable and fruit market .Then after reaching to the Technical chowk take left
                and go almost 180m .Now you are on the gate of Government Polytechnic Muzaffarpur.<br>
                For Admission, take all your required documents alongwith 12 photos that you have posted in DCECE
                Examinations.
                Now ask the gateman or guards that your purpose for Admission.
