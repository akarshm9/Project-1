        The building is so awesome. It has 2 floors:1st and terrace.Sitting arrangement is not so good. Because, some candidates get their seats with facing some problems.

        <p class="dem">
            Demarite of the area is there are many trucks travel there because that is an industrial area and transport is essential for industrial processes.Sometimes there is a very strange and very bad smelled by everyone.And due to presence of trucks the conditions of traffic jam is common.Another demarite is that some students use cigarrettes and other elements.

        <p class="cheating">
            Guarding in the exam center is neither strict nor easy.It depends upon your invigilator that how he is.To get cheats go to the bathroom and hide the cheats before examination.And go then cheat exam.If once you have caught cheating by a strict teacher then you will get some punishments or your marks may be reduced.      </p>
